                    Salah began his senior career in 2010 at Al-Mokawloon, departing in 2012 to join Basel, where he won two Swiss Super League titles. In 2014, he joined Chelsea for a reported fee of £11 million, but limited gametime led to successive loans to Fiorentina and Roma, who later signed him permanently for €15 million. In the 2016-17 season, Salah was a key figure in Roma's unsuccessful title bid, reaching double figures in both goals and assists. In 2017, Salah moved to Liverpool for £36.9 million, a club record at the time. In his first season, he set the record for most Premier League goals scored (32) in a 38-game season and helped Liverpool to the 2018 Champions League final. Having formed a formidable attacking trio with Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané, Salah went on to be an integral player in the club's Champions League and Premier League title successes in the following two seasons. He has since also won the FA Cup, EFL Cup, FA Community Shield, UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup. In the 2024-25 season, he won a second league title while breaking the record for the most goal contributions in a 38 game Premier League campaign. For his performances during the season, he won the PFA Players' Player of the Year award for a record-breaking third time.
