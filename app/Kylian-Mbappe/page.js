                <p>Kylian Mbappé (born December 20, 1998, Paris, France) is a French football (soccer) player whose speed and goal scoring as an attacker have made him a dominant force in European club competition. In 2022 he became the first player in football history to have scored four career goals in World Cup finals.</p>

                <h3 className='h3_class'>Early life </h3>
                <p> Kylian Mbappé was born in Paris and grew up in Bondy, one of the Parisian suburbs (banlieues) with working-class, mostly immigrant residents. His mother, Fayza Lamari, is of Algerian descent, and his father, Wilfried Mbappé, had immigrated from Cameroon. Wilfried Mbappé was a coach and director for the local club AS Bondy, and his son joined the club's youth teams at age six.
                </p>
                <p> Kylian Mbappé quickly became known for his exceptional speed and ball handling, and, several years later, he was selected to train at Clairefontaine, France's national academy for elite football players. He spent two years there, and a number of notable European clubs—among them Real Madrid, Arsenal, Chelsea, and Paris Saint-Germain (PSG)—expressed an interest in signing him.
                    <p>
                        In 2013, at age 14, he signed with AS Monaco, which competes in Ligue 1 (France's top-division league), and he played on the club's youth and under-19 teams.

                <h3>Club play: AS Monaco and PSG</h3>
                <p>When Mbappé made his debut with AS Monaco's first team—on December 2, 2015—he was just a few weeks shy of his 17th birthday. He was at that time the youngest first-team player in the club's history. (Thierry Henry had previously been the youngest.) Mbappé scored only one goal and saw limited playing time during the 2015-16 season.</p>

                <p>In 2016-17, however, he scored 15 goals, which tied him for fifth among Ligue 1 players, and AS Monaco captured the Ligue 1 title. Powered by Mbappé and teammate Radamel Falcao, the team defeated Manchester City and Borussia Dortmund in knockout matches as it advanced to the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Champions League semifinals, where it lost to Juventus.
                </p>

                <p>In August 2017 Mbappé moved to PSG, which also signed Neymar, a prolific Brazilian scorer. Together they led PSG to three consecutive Ligue 1 titles (2017-18, 2018-19, and 2019-20). Mbappé was named the league's Player of the Year for the 2018-19 season, when he scored 33 goals, the most in Ligue 1. He led the league in goals in each of the next three seasons, and he again earned league Player of the Year honors in 2020-21, and 2021-22.
                </p>

                <p>In 2021 PSG signed Lionel Messi, another of the world's best football players, and the team, now featuring one of the most talented front lines in the history of the sport, won the Ligue 1 title in 2021-22. Mbappé subsequently agreed to a new contract that could, via an extension clause, keep him at PSG through 2025. The contract also, reportedly, made him the world's highest-paid football player. In 2022-23, for the fifth season in a row, Mbappé led Ligue 1 in goals scored, and he was again named league Player of the Year; PSG also won another Ligue 1 championship. The 2023-24 season saw PSG win Ligue 1 again and Mbappé receive Player of the Year honors again—the team's third consecutive title and Mbappé's fifth consecutive win.</p>

                <p>It was widely reported in February 2024 that Mbappé had informed PSG that he would not exercise his contract's extension clause and thus intended to leave the club after the 2023-24 season. In May 2024 Mbappé said on social media he would be leaving PSG, and in June 2024 Real Madrid officially announced he would be joining that club. In his first season for Real Madrid (2024-25), Mbappé scored a total of 43 goals across competitions, including 31 goals in the La Liga, to become the league's top scorer that season.</p>

                    International career
                </h3>
                <p>In 2016 at the UEFA European Under-19 Championship, Mbappé led France's national team to victory. He played his first match with the French men's national team in 2017, and he soon emerged as one of its main scoring threats. During the 2018 World Cup he became—at age 19—the youngest French player ever to score in World Cup competition. His goal gave France a 1-0 group-stage victory over Peru, and the French team advanced to the knockout stages of the tournament, where it eventually defeated Croatia 4-2 in the tournament's final. Mbappé scored the last of his team's goals, becoming the second teenager to score in a World Cup final. (Pelé was the first, in 1958.) Mbappé received the World Cup's Best Young Player award for his performance, which included scoring four goals.</p>

                <p>In 2021 Mbappé scored the winning goal for France in the final of the UEFA Nations League tournament, defeating Spain. At the 2022 World Cup he scored eight goals in seven matches—the most of any player in the tournament, which won him the Golden Boot award. In the tournament final, Mbappé scored three goals and twice brought the French team from behind to tie Argentina, which was led by his PSG teammate Messi, but France ultimately lost on penalty kicks. With his three goals, Mbappé became the first player in history to have tallied four career World Cup final goals.</p>

                <p>Mbappé's success in international play for France made him a star in his home country, particularly in the banlieues where he grew up. When asked in a 2021 interview with Esquire magazine about what it means to be a “French icon,” he said,</p>

                <blockquote className='blockquote'>I've always felt French. I don't renounce my origins, because they are part of who I am, but I've made my whole life in France, and never at any moment was I made to feel I wasn't at home here.</blockquote>

                <p>But in the wake of the French team's lackluster performance in the run-up to the 2022 World Cup, Mbappé was subjected to racist abuse that, according to a 2022 interview with Sports Illustrated, made him consider leaving the team. In the end, he decided to stay:
                </p>

                <blockquote className='blockquote'>But after, I take the reflection with all the people who play around me and root for me, and I think it was not the good message to give up. Because I think I'm an example for everybody.…This is the new France.…It's for that, that I didn't give up the national team. Because it is a message to the young generation to say, 'We are stronger than that.'</blockquote>
