                <p>John Felix Anthony Cena (born April 23, 1977) is an American professional wrestler and actor. Signed to WWE since 2001, he is a record 17-time world champion, holding the most recognized world title reigns in the promotion's history, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers in WWE of all time. Cena has also starred in numerous films and television shows, including The Marine (2006), Bumblebee (2018), and F9 (2021), as well as starring in the television series Peacemaker (2022-2025) as the eponymous lead.

                    Originally pursuing a bodybuilding career, Cena began wrestling in 1999 and signed with WWE in 2001 to its developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). After debuting on the main roster on SmackDown! in 2002, he rose to prominence as a brash, villainous rapper before becoming the company's top heroic figure from the mid-2000s to the mid-2010s. From 2018, he began working a reduced schedule. His run as a face from 2003 to 2025 was the longest continuous portrayal of a heroic character in WWE history. Cena has headlined multiple major WWE pay-per-views, including its flagship event, WrestleMania, six times (22, 23, 27, 28, 29, and 41 - Night 2). He has held numerous championships and accomplishments, including 14 WWE Championships and 3 World Heavyweight Championships. He is also a two-time Royal Rumble and one-time Money in the Bank winner. His full-time career received mixed critical and audience reception, with praise for his character work and promotional skills but criticism for his perceived over-representation and on-screen dominance relative to other wrestlers. In contrast, his later career has been more positively received.

                    Outside of his wrestling career, Cena has acted in both comedies and action films, receiving praise for his roles in Trainwreck (2015), Blockers (2018), and The Suicide Squad (2021). In 2005 he released a rap album, You Can't See Me, which peaked at No. 15 on the Billboard 200. Known for his charity work, Cena has granted more than 650 wishes for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, the most in the organization's history.
