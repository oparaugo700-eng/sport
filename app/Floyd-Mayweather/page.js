                    As of July 2025, BoxRec ranks him the third greatest boxer of all time, pound for pound. Mayweather was named "Fighter of the Decade" for the 2010s by the Boxing Writers Association of America (BWAA) and The Sporting News, a two-time winner of The Ring magazine's Fighter of the Year award (1998 and 2007), a three-time winner of the BWAA Fighter of the Year award (2007, 2013, and 2015), and a six-time winner of the Best Fighter ESPY Award (2007-2010, 2012-2014).

                    He is referred to as one of the best defensive boxers in history: since the existence of CompuBox, Mayweather is the most accurate puncher among professional boxers, having the highest plus-minus ratio in recorded boxing history. He has a tied record with Joe Louis of 26 consecutive wins in world title fights. He also holds 24 wins (7 KOs) against former or current world titlists, and 8 wins (3 KOs) against International Boxing Hall of Fame inductees. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in the class of 2021.
